            I just wanted to remind you that i love you with all my heart and im so thankful that you're in my life,i will always be by your side my love. Some fall in love with a pretty face, some fall in love with a kind heart - I found both of these within you. Never forget how special you are to Me.<br/><br/>
â€¨
My name meaning is the Sanskrit name for Vega, the brightest star in the northern constellation of Lyra. It also refers to a period of 48 minutes centered on solar noon which is considered a good time (Muhurat) to start any task. But for me Youâ€™re my brightest star from all the constellation 
I know itâ€™s kind of filmy one or the poetic one but if you gonna ask for me how much you mean to me then this is it Youâ€™re my comfort, youâ€™re my home, youâ€™re my love and most lovable person i had ever met I wasnâ€™t believing that this all is happening with me and you were becoming so special to me.<br/><br/>
â€¨
Every morning, I wake up with a big smile on my face, thinking about spending my day with you. You are always on my mind, and I wait for every second to see you and have you by my side. My life has a different meaning now, as you are a part of it. You make me feel weak in the knees and give me butterflies in the stomach. It is a wonderful feeling to be around you. I never thought I could feel this about someone. It is incredible how your sheer presence makes me happy. I love the way you make me feel. I started loving sleeping at night because even though we are away, I get to see you in my dreams, fulfilling every bit of my life. I see us sharing our lives and weaving our beautiful future. My dreams make my belief in â€˜usâ€™ stronger.<br/><br/>
â€¨
The jitters I experience inside me are something that I have never experienced before. It is irresistibly ecstatic to be in your presence and share the fondness that I have for you. You are an angel who has come to my life to make it worthy and meaningful. You are everything that my heart was looking for. I feel blessed to have you in my life. My heart races every time you smile, and I skip a beat when you look at me. The feeling differs from infatuation, as I have never felt this way. Everything you do profoundly impacts me, and I cannot get over the thought of being with you. When I saw you for the first time, I was struck by your magnetic aura. Something about you is so unique that it draws me towards you like a moth to a flame. It is irresistible to like you. I know you a little more every day and like you even more. You are the cutest person I know and the kindest of all. Your pure heart, honesty, and sentimentality have won over me. <br/><br/>
          I take this opportunity to ask for your consent if you want to be my
          life partner.This letter is a token of my love for you. <br/>
